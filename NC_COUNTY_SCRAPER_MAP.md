## Counties Without Scraper Coverage

Only **1 county** has no scraper coverage:

| County | Population | Reason |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Randolph** | 145K | Uses Bid4Assets auction platform (complex JavaScript, not easily scrapable) |

**Note:** While 99 counties have scraper coverage, not all counties have active foreclosure listings at any given time. Many counties covered by law firms may show zero properties because they have no current foreclosures.

## Important Notes

### Coverage vs. Active Listings

**Coverage** means a scraper exists for that county. **Active listings** means the county currently has properties for sale.

Many covered counties show **zero properties** because:
1. The county has no current foreclosures (common in wealthy/growing areas)
2. The law firm handles that county but no sales are scheduled
3. Foreclosure activity is seasonal or sporadic

### Law Firm Behavior

Law firms like Kania and Hutchens handle foreclosures for many counties, but they only list properties when:
- A county has an active foreclosure case
- The property has reached the public sale stage
- The upset bid period is active

This is why you might see Kania covering 28 counties but only showing properties in 4 counties at any given time.

### Scraper Maintenance

County websites and law firm portals change frequently. If a scraper stops working:
1. Check the Admin Panel → Scrape History for error messages
2. The scraper file may need updates to match website changes
3. Contact technical support for scraper repairs

## Using This Reference

### For Deployment
When setting up the application, you can run any of the 21 scrapers to populate your database. Law firm scrapers (Kania, Hutchens, ZLS, RBCWB) are recommended as they cover multiple counties in a single run.

### For Development
If you need to add a new county scraper, check this list first to see if it's already covered by a law firm scraper. Building a county-specific scraper is only necessary if:
- The county is not covered by any law firm
- The county has a unique format not handled by existing scrapers
- You need more frequent updates than the law firm provides

### For Users
Use the Admin Panel to see which scrapers have recently run and which counties have active properties. The Properties page shows the source of each listing, so you can verify which scraper found each property.
