## Research Strategy

### Phase 1: Verify Hutchens Coverage
- Check if Hutchens Law Firm already covers the "high priority" counties
- Run Hutchens scraper to see which counties have active listings

### Phase 2: Research Tier 1 Counties (5 counties)
- Search for "[County] NC tax deed foreclosure sales"
- Check county tax office websites
- Identify law firms handling foreclosures
- Document auction platforms (Bid4Assets, GovEase, etc.)

### Phase 3: Build New Scrapers
- Prioritize law firm scrapers (cover multiple counties)
- Build county-specific scrapers where needed
- Integrate with existing infrastructure

### Phase 4: Test and Deploy
- Test each new scraper
- Add to admin panel
- Integrate with daily automation
- Update documentation

---

## Expected Outcomes

**Realistic Goal:** 75-80 counties covered (up from 64)
- Hutchens may already cover 5-10 of the "missing" counties
- 5-10 additional counties likely have scrapable data
- Remaining counties may not have online foreclosure data

**Stretch Goal:** 85+ counties covered
- Would require PDF parsers for counties that only publish PDFs
- May need to handle non-standard formats

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Verify Hutchens scraper is working and check which counties it covers
2. ⏳ Research Tier 1 high-priority counties (Union, New Hanover, Buncombe, Davidson, Rowan)
3. ⏳ Build scrapers for newly identified sources
4. ⏳ Test and integrate new scrapers
5. ⏳ Update documentation and save checkpoint
