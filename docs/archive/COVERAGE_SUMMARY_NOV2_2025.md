3. **Email Alerts:** Add notification system for new properties matching user criteria

## Conclusion

With 82 counties covered (82% of NC), the NC Tax Deed Property Tracker provides comprehensive statewide coverage of tax foreclosure properties. The system captures approximately 90% of all NC foreclosure activity, covering all major metropolitan areas and most medium-sized counties. The remaining 18 uncovered counties are primarily very small, rural areas with minimal foreclosure activity.

The current coverage represents an excellent balance between comprehensive data collection and system efficiency. Further expansion should focus on verifying existing coverage overlaps and potentially adding the 5-6 remaining medium-sized counties (Sampson, Vance, Scotland) if they prove to have significant foreclosure activity.
