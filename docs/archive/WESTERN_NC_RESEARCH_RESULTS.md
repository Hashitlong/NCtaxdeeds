## Key Findings

**Western NC counties generally do NOT have online foreclosure systems.**

Possible reasons:
1. **Lower foreclosure rates** - Mountain/rural counties may have fewer tax delinquencies
2. **Traditional methods** - Rely on newspaper advertisements and courthouse postings
3. **Smaller tax departments** - Don't have resources for online systems
4. **Law firm coverage** - May outsource to law firms (Kania, ZLS)

## Western NC Coverage Status

**Current: 10/32 counties (31%)**

**Realistic Maximum: 12-15/32 counties (38-47%)**
- Most Western NC counties don't have online foreclosure systems
- Law firms (Kania, ZLS) may cover a few more
- Unlikely to exceed 50% coverage in Western NC

## Recommendation

**Accept 31-40% Western NC coverage** as realistic goal. Focus efforts on:

1. **Verify law firm coverage** - Check if Kania/ZLS handle any of the missing Western counties
2. **Eastern/Central NC** - These counties more likely to have online systems
3. **Feature improvements** - Better use of existing 49-county coverage

Western NC is primarily rural/mountain counties that rely on traditional foreclosure methods (newspaper ads, courthouse postings) rather than online systems.
