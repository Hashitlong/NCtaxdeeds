# Archive - Historical Research & Development Documents

This directory contains 38 research and analysis documents from the development process. These files are kept for historical reference but are **not needed for deployment**.

## Why These Are Archived

During development (October-November 2025), we:
1. Researched all 100 NC counties to find online foreclosure systems
2. Built scrapers incrementally (started with 8, grew to 21)
3. Analyzed coverage gaps and prioritized counties
4. Documented findings in real-time

These documents contain **snapshots from different points in time**, so they have varying statistics:
- Some say "8 scrapers" (early development)
- Some say "14 scrapers" (mid development)
- Some say "18 scrapers" (late development)
- **Current reality: 21 scrapers** (as of Nov 6, 2025)

## For Current Information

**Don't read these archived files for current statistics!**

Instead, read these files in the project root:
- **PROJECT_FACTS.md** - Single source of truth
- **NC_COUNTY_SCRAPER_MAP.md** - All 100 counties mapped
- **FINAL_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md** - Pre-export verification
- **README.md** - Project overview

## When to Read These Files

You might find these useful if you want to:
- Understand the research process
- See which counties were investigated
- Learn why certain counties don't have scrapers
- Review historical decision-making

But for **deployment and operation**, you don't need any of these files.
