## Research Plan

1. Visit each county's website to find foreclosure listings
2. Categorize by format:
   - Simple HTML table (priority)
   - PDF format
   - Law firm (check if already covered)
   - Complex format
   - No online listings
3. Build scrapers for simple HTML formats immediately
4. Document findings for other formats

## Expected Outcomes

- **Best case**: 5-8 new simple scrapers
- **Likely**: 2-4 new scrapers + several already covered by law firms
- **Reality**: Many small counties may have no active foreclosures or no online listings
